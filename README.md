> A mobile app that translates sign language into speech, making communication easier for sign language users.
>
> SignSpeak aims to bridge the communication gap by providing a user-friendly platform that translates sign language into spoken words in real-time. We believe in enhancing accessibility and ensuring effective communication.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to sign into the app, so I can start translating my signs into speech.
- As a user, I want to customize my settings, so I can choose my preferred language and voice.
- As a user, I want to receive real-time notifications, so I can stay informed about my translations.

###  SignSpeak is built using the following technologies:

    - This project leverages the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/), a versatile platform enabling cross-platform app development with a single codebase for mobile, desktop, and web applications.
    - For data persistence, the app utilizes the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package, allowing the creation of a custom storage schema and saving data to a local database.
    - To handle local push notifications, the app employs the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package, which is compatible with Android, iOS, and macOS.
    - ðŸš¨ Note: Notifications on macOS are currently non-functional due to a known issue we're actively addressing!
    - The app features the ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) font as its primary typeface and follows material design guidelines throughout its user interface.

<!-- How to run -->
<img src="./readme/title10.svg"/>

> To set up SignSpeak locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Flutter**: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Laravel**: [Install Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/installation)
- **Python**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Uvicorn**: For running the Python server (installed via pip)

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AliAljawad/SignSpeak.git
   cd sign-speak
   ```
#### 2. Flutter Frontend Setup
  - Open your Android emulator.
  - Navigate to the Flutter project directory.
  - Run the following commands:
   ```bash
      flutter pub get
      flutter run
   ```
   This will start the Flutter frontend on your emulator.
#### 3. Laravel Backend Setup
- Navigate to the Flutter project directory.
- Run the following command to serve the backend:
```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
#### 4. Python Model and WebSocket Setup
- Navigate to the Python model directory:
```bash
   cd SignDetectionModel
   ```
- Install the required dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
- To start the WebSocket server for real-time translation, run:
```bash
   python ./webSocket_classifier.py
```
- To start the server that handles uploaded images and videos, run:
```bash
   python -m uvicorn uploaded_files_classifier:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

Now you should be able to run the SignSpeak app locally, with real-time translation and video/image upload features.
